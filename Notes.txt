As a Devops Engineer at Craftista, you have been tasked with deploying the Frontend app written in NodeJS as a Pod. Write a YAML spec using the following details and apply it to create a Pod.

Pod Name	craftista-frontend
Labels	role: frontend
project: craftista
version: v1
Container Name	frontend
Container Image	schoolofdevops/craftista-frontend:v1
Port	3000
CPU Resources	minimum = “40m” , max = “200m”
Memory	minimum = “56Mi” , max = “138Mi”
Only when you have a working Pod running in the cluster, mark this as complete.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you have cloned the CKA Challenges Repo if you haven’t already.

git clone https://github.com/schoolofdevops/cka-challenges.git
Even if you have cloned it already, update it using,

cd cka-challenges
git pull origin master
Apply the pod spec in 014 directory of cka-challenges

cd 014 
kubectl apply -f podA.yaml -f podB.yaml

After applying these manifests, you will see two pods, namely poda and podb launched but not running as follows

root@k8s-dojo-01:~/cka-challenges/014# kubectl get pods
NAME                             READY   STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE
kube-ops-view-574589986d-dzdvw   1/1     Running        0          36h
poda                             0/1     ErrImagePull   0          11s
podb                             0/1     Pending        0          11s
vote                             1/1     Running        0          34h
web                              2/2     Running        0          34h
Your task is to debug the issues, find the root cause, fix it and make sure they are in running state.

Ultimately clean these up using a script in the same path as,

bash cleanup.sh

Only when you have a both the Pods running in the cluster, mark this as complete.

You have been tasked to create a multi container pod which runs nginx app along with redis and memcache with the following spec,

Pod Name	multi-c-pod
Labels	role: multic
app: nginx
project: demo
version: v1
Container 1 Name	nginx
Container 1 Image	nginx:alpine
Container 1 Port	80
Container 2 Name	redis
Container 2 Image	redis:alpine
Container 2Port	6379
Container 3 Name	cache
Container 3 Image	memcached:alpine
Container 3 Port	11211
Only when you have a working Pod muti-c-pod running in the cluster with 3 containers , mark this as complete.

Problem Statement.
Create a Pod that has one nginx application Container and one Init Container in such way that:

Init container should be fetching the webpage of google.com using the command wget -O /work-dir/index.html" http://google.com
Same fetched page should be shared with nginx container.
nginx container will mount that shared page at /usr/share/nginx/html
Steps:
From cka-challenges/010 path, edit the nginx-init-pod.yaml to support the requirement above,

Deploy the pod with,

cd cka-challenges/010/ 
kubectl apply -f nginx-init-pod.yaml
Cleanup
cd cka-challenges/010/ kubectl delete -f nginx-init-pod.yaml

Skills Needed:
Pod Spec
Volume
Emptydir
Init container
Basic Linux
References:
Storage: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/
InitContainer: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/
Only when you have a working Pod nginx-init running in the cluster which server the page added by init container , mark this as complete
